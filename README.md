# Lean Data Pipeline

A lightweight, efficient, and modular pipeline for cleaning and preprocessing messy datasets. Designed for data science workflows, machine learning preprocessing, and automated data analysis.

## 🔍 Features

- Handles missing values (mean, median, mode imputation)
- Fixes categorical inconsistencies (e.g., '3+' → '3')
- Converts data types for modeling
- Encodes categorical variables
- Scales numeric features
- Modular and customizable

```

## 📊 Example Use Case

```python
from scripts.clean_data import clean_dataset

df = pd.read_csv("data/raw_dataset.csv")
cleaned_df = clean_dataset(df)
```
